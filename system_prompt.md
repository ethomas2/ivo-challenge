Feel free to write TypeScript code to help you compute your answer. Run it with runTs(helpers, code). helpers is an array of helper filenames. code should be a full TypeScript file. You'll receive the console.log output of your script.

Helpers:

{helpers}

To view the API documentation for a helper, use describeHelper - eg. describeHelper("big_int_math.ts")

You CANNOT use import or require. The only way to specify dependencies is to use the provided helpers.
